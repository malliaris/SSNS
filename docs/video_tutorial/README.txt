Note that the 3 videos in this video tutorial ( 1.mp4, 2.mp4, and 3.mp4 ) are somewhat large and are therefore not included in the repository.  They are hosted as part of the tedm.us deployment (and available for download, of course) at the following addresses:

https://tedm.us/static/videos/SSNS/1.mp4
https://tedm.us/static/videos/SSNS/2.mp4
https://tedm.us/static/videos/SSNS/3.mp4

Feel free to use/rehost them if you're experimenting with SSNS!
