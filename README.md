## Overview

**SSNS** is a web app that offers interactive exploration of various simple models/maps/equations/processes from a variety STEM fields.  The common theme is that they all involve straightforward update equations and display stochastic and/or nonlinear behavior.  In that sense, **SSNS** is a **S**imple **S**tochastic and **N**onlinear **S**imulator.

Being a web app, **SSNS** makes heavy use of HTML/CSS.  All computation and logic is done in object-oriented JavaScript &mdash; a "back-end" that actually runs client-side in the web browser.  The front-end is a user interface built with [Bootstrap](https://getbootstrap.com/) and [flot](https://www.flotcharts.org/) plotting.  Read on for details...

## Where To Find Things

**SSNS** can always be found "live" at [tedm.us/SSNS](https://tedm.us/SSNS).  If you're interested in knowing more about the app's design and code, here are some places to look:

* the app's integrated help viewer; visit [tedm.us/SSNS](https://tedm.us/SSNS) and click the big yellow "?"
* the JavaScript source ([<samp>/js/</samp>](/js/) and [<samp>/js/system_types/</samp>](/js/system_types/)), and the HTML source in [<samp>SSNS.html</samp>](SSNS.html)
* this README document
* the [<samp>/docs/class_diagrams/</samp>](/docs/class_diagrams/), which summarize the structure of the code; individual diagrams (example below) in both <samp>svg</samp> and <samp>pdf</samp>, and [<samp>all.pdf</samp>](/docs/class_diagrams/all.pdf), which contains all diagrams

<a href="/docs/class_diagrams/Trajectory_inheritance_-_no_section_label.svg"><img src="/docs/class_diagrams/Trajectory_inheritance_-_no_section_label.svg"></a>

The source code is well structured and commented, but not the fastest way to get the gist of things.  The app itself aims to be simple, intuitive, and accessible &mdash; diving right in and relying on the integrated help viewer is a great way to get started.  There is plenty of overlap between the content of the help viewer pages and this README.  However, the former is organized as a linked network of small chunks of info, while the latter is more verbose, more focused on the code/computation, and doesn't discuss the conceptual side of things.

## Classes, Hierarchies, etc.

The example class diagram pictured above and its companions in the [<samp>/docs/class_diagrams/</samp>](/docs/class_diagrams/) directory capture the structure of the **SSNS** code.  Individual diagrams will be linked to in this section as they come up.

The central class of the **SSNS** app is the <samp>Trajectory</samp>.  An implemented model/map/equation/process is referred to as a "system type" (for lack of a better term).  Each system type has its own <samp>Trajectory</samp> subclass &mdash; a leaf node on the <a href="/docs/class_diagrams/Trajectory_inheritance_-_no_section_label.svg"><samp>Trajectory</samp> inheritance</a> tree.  Its two-letter [abbreviation](#abbreviations-labels-etc) gives the subclass its name, e.g., <samp>Trajectory_XY</samp>.  There are also intermediate-level subclasses, e.g., <samp>Trajectory_Stoch</samp>.  The XY model uses stochastic machinery, so <samp>Trajectory_XY</samp> inherits from <samp>Trajectory_Stoch</samp>, which inherits from <samp>Trajectory</samp>.

A <samp>Trajectory</samp> object contains everything needed to generate output &mdash; and store it for "playback" &mdash; via discrete-time update equations.  Each <samp>Trajectory</samp> is <a href="/docs/class_diagrams/Trajectory_composition_-_no_section_label.svg">composed</a> of a <samp>ModelCalc</samp> object (to perform all model-specific calculations), and one or more <samp>TrajSeg</samp> objects to hold the trajectory data.  A <samp>TrajSeg</samp> represents a portion ("segment") of a trajectory evolved with a particular set of parameter values.  It is thus <a href="/docs/class_diagrams/TrajSeg_composition_-_no_section_label.svg">composed</a> of one <samp>Params</samp> object and one or more <samp>Coords</samp> objects.  Each <samp>Coords</samp> holds all dependent variable data for a single time step &mdash; it could be a single scalar value, or a large 2D matrix of values, integer or floating point, etc.

There are system-type-dependent class hierarchies for <a href="/docs/class_diagrams/Coords_inheritance.svg"><samp>Coords</samp></a> objects, <a href="/docs/class_diagrams/Params_inheritance.svg"><samp>Params</samp></a> objects, and <a href="/docs/class_diagrams/ModelCalc_inheritance.svg"><samp>ModelCalc</samp></a> objects.  At the cost of some flexibility, it was possible to keep the <samp>TrajSeg</samp> class system-type-independent, so it <em>does not</em> have a hierarchy.  On the data visualization side of things, there is an inheritance hierarchy for the <samp>PlotType</samp> class.  Its diagram will be available shortly.  Referring to the section on [abbreviations](#abbreviations-labels-etc) can be helpful when viewing these hierarchies.

The following classes, which are listed roughly from "largest" (i.e., "outermost") to "smallest," are not part of the <samp>Trajectory</samp> "ecosystem."  They do not have large class hierarchies, and are mainly used as single instances:

* <samp>Simulator</samp><br/>Class that encompasses all **SSNS** app logic.  Instantiated between a pair of <samp>script</samp> tags at end of [<samp>SSNS.html</samp>](SSNS.html).
* <samp>UserInterface</samp>
* <samp>PlottingMachinery</samp>
* <samp>RunState</samp><br/>Trajectory creation/navigation can be done either in a continuous-action mode (e.g., hit "Record" and let it run), or in one-off step/jumps.  This class keeps track of what mode the app is in, what direction it is "running," etc.
* <samp>UINI</samp> = **U**ser **I**nterface **N**umerical **I**nput<br/>See [Input/Output](#inputoutput) section.
* <samp>HelpViewerNode</samp>
* <samp>HelpViewer</samp><br/>A modal-lightbox-based network of help pages, always accessible by clicking the big yellow "?".  Each help page is represented by a <samp>HelpViewerNode</samp>, and identified by an <samp>id</samp> like <samp>HV_ST_XY</samp> (the **H**elp **V**iewer page for **S**ystem **T**ype <samp>XY</samp>).  See [abbreviations](#abbreviations-labels-etc) and [Help Viewer "Sitemap"](#help-viewer-sitemap) for more.

The **SSNS** JavaScript code is separated into several source files, all located in the [<samp>/js/</samp>](/js/) and [<samp>/js/system_types/</samp>](/js/system_types/) directories.  The following table indicates which of the above-described classes each source file contains.

## External Libraries, Dependencies

There are many fantastic JavaScript libraries out there!  **SSNS** relies on:

* [stdlib.js](https://stdlib.io/)<br/>for data structures, statistics, and pseudorandom number generation
* [flot](https://www.flotcharts.org/)<br/>for creating plots of trajectory data (flot does not have support for heat maps, so the native HTML <samp>&lt;canvas&gt;</samp> element is used instead)
* [Bootstrap](https://getbootstrap.com/)<br/>for UI components and responsive layout that displays well on both mobile and desktop browsers
* [KaTeX](https://www.katex.org/)<br/>for typesetting of math expressions
* [jQuery](https://jquery.com/)<br/>for simple and concise interaction with the HTML DOM
* [Font Awesome](https://fontawesome.com/)<br/>for nifty icons

For convenience, a minified bundle of all of these JavaScript dependencies is available in [<samp>SSNS_dependencies.js</samp>](dependencies/SSNS_dependencies.js).  There is version info within it.  As for stylesheets, the [<samp>SSNS.html</samp>](SSNS.html) <samp>&lt;head&gt;</samp> section has links to the CSS files for the Bootstrap and KaTeX libraries, as well as [<samp>SSNS.css</samp>](SSNS.css), which contains a small amount of **SSNS**-specific styling.

## Abbreviations, Labels, etc.

If you're trying to orient yourself in the code, the table of abbreviations below should keep things from feeling like total alphabet soup!

Many of the code's JavaScript variable names use two-letter abbreviations to indicate category, subcategory, etc.  For example, when using the Logistic Map (<samp>LM</samp>) system type, the derived class involved is <samp>Trajectory_LM</samp>.  <samp>PlotType</samp> derived classes contain two such abbreviations, e.g., <samp>PlotTypeXT_LM</samp>; the first abbreviation corresponds to the intermediate level branches in the <samp>PlotType</samp> [class hierarchy](#classes-hierarchies-etc); the second abbreviation, to the leaf nodes.

These abbreviations are also used in HTML element <samp>id</samp> attributes.  For instance <samp>UI_P_SP_MN_mu</samp> stands for "User Interface &mdash; Parameters &mdash; Stochastic Processes &mdash; Moran Model &mdash; parameter mu."  Every two-letter abbreviation above is unique ***across all categories***.

## Code Design

The decision to write the **SSNS** code in JavaScript was not a hard one.  The requirements were, roughly:

* app should be accessible by web browser, quick to load, and not require installation of anything
* app should have a well-designed, easy-to-use, responsive UI
* language/library setup should offer basic scientific computing tools, including pseudorandom numbers; raw computational power is not as important 
* language/library setup should offer standard object-oriented programming capabilities
* app should have good graphical plot output

Pure, client-side JavaScript was really the only option that met all these requirements.  Also, in particular, pure Javascript offered the best chance of maintaining a rapid feedback loop between (1) user action, (2) computation, and (3) plot output.  It was also the simplest choice, free from complicating factors such as: repeated web requests, Ajax, transmission of data/graphics, dependence on sustained network connectivity.  Years ago, <em>Java</em> code in the form of an applet might have been considered, but not anymore 😀.

While the first two requirements above were easily met, the last three required some trying and testing.  Briefly commenting on those three, in order:

* Of all the scientific computing needs, pseudorandom number generation proved to be the trickiest to satisfy.  JavaScript's <samp>Math.random()</samp> does not allow seeding or accessing the generator's state.  The closest thing to a JavaScript stand-in for NumPy/SciPy appears to be [stdlib.js](https://stdlib.io/), which fortunately proved sufficient for our purposes.

* It was great to see that, as part of its 2015 revised standard, JavaScript added "true" classes.  ("Objects" had long been part of the language, but the term refers to a key-value-pair container, not a class instance.)  Certain OOP features like multiple constructors are still not possible, but, overall, JavaScript met the code's [structural](#classes-hierarchies-etc) needs just fine.

* There doesn't seem to be a JavaScript equivalent of the Python plotting library [matplotlib](https://matplotlib.org/).  Many web plotting packages focus on data exploration and novel visualization techniques, while we just needed something straightforward and lightweight.  The [flot](https://www.flotcharts.org/) library proved to be a good option.  It has very nice auto-scaling functionality.  Its capabilities were supplemented by the HTML <samp>&lt;canvas&gt;</samp> element for heat maps.

The current (finalized?) list of dependencies is [here](#external-libraries-dependencies).  With the more difficult requirements met, it was easy to focus on the areas where HTML/CSS/js excels, namely: UI, icons, fonts, etc.  Also, having the **SSNS** code reside and run purely on the client-side has some advantages for user experience:

* Controlling execution is easy: the app can be loaded, used, and then left dormant in a browser tab &mdash; any generated data just sits there.  Closing the tab/window at any time will close the app, even if it is running.

* Browser developer tools are designed to assist app developers, but they can provide useful information to app users as well.  Specifically, the JavaScript console will log an informational message, e.g., when switching system type.

* The app source code is of course available on GitHub, but also viewable "under the hood" by selecting "View Source" in the browser.

## Input/Output

All input to the app is done via the user interface.  On load, the app plots the trajectory of the default system type.  At that point, there is only one time point &mdash; the default initial condition &mdash; so pressing "play" does nothing!  More trajectory must be generated by pressing "record."  With two or more time steps, all trajectory navigation commands become available.  (Some users might expect something like a music player, but the app is more like an audio recorder.)

In addition to buttons and checkboxes, the app has many text input fields for passing in numbers.  Each is presented in a "block," with a symbol/word label on a blue or green background on the left.  Some blocks also have related controls on the right.  Under the hood, each input field uses an HTML <samp>&lt;input&gt;</samp> element with <samp>type="number"</samp>.  Note that many numeric input features, e.g., small increment/decrement arrows or popup numeric keyboards, will depend on choice of browser and screen width.

In the "layer" just below the HTML input fields, each input is managed by an instance of the <samp>UINI</samp> (**U**ser **I**nterface **N**umerical **I**nput) class.  This way, we can take advantage of existing web functionality, e.g., <samp>js</samp> event listeners, while still inserting customized handling where necessary.  The <samp>UINI</samp> class involves:

* a first round of input cleaning as <samp>&lt;input type="number"&gt;</samp> removes white space and most non-numeric characters
* subclasses <samp>UINI_int</samp> and <samp>UINI_float</samp>, with appropriate treatment of leading zeros, etc.  (JavaScript has only a single multipurpose <samp>Number</samp> type, so we rely on <samp>Number.isInteger()</samp>)
* use of the <samp>&lt;input&gt;</samp> element's <samp>value</samp> attribute to store the quantity's default value (read on app load by <samp>UINI</samp> constructor) and subsequent user-entered values
* an internal, "official," validated value for the quantity; it sits between the UI and <samp>Trajectory</samp> "insertion points"; if user input is received that is ***not*** a decipherable number, this internal value is immediately pushed back to the UI
* use of the <samp>&lt;input&gt;</samp> element's <samp>min</samp> and <samp>max</samp> attributes to store the quantity's range; if user input is received that ***is*** a decipherable number, but is out of range, it is immediately "auto-corrected" to the nearest in-range value
* the pushing of previously entered valid values back to the UI; this occurs for system parameters when crossing <samp>TrajSeg</samp> boundaries during "playback"

Outputting trajectory data is not implemented, nor planned, but would be very doable, e.g., by saving to disk or opening a new tab with text data.  Screenshots are always possible, of course 😀.  Reading saved trajectory data from disk also not implemented, nor planned, but doable.

For those who favor keyboard over mouse and desktop over mobile:

* hit <samp>TAB</samp> to cycle through input buttons/fields; <samp>SHIFT-TAB</samp> to reverse
* if a button is currently selected, hit or hold <samp>ENTER</samp> to repeatedly "press" it
* if a numerical input is currently selected, hit or hold up/down arrows to change the value

Browser developer tools are indispensable when doing development, but also handy when running the code.  A number of <samp>console.log()</samp> statements are embedded in the JavaScript to print informational messages for convenience.

## To Do/Fix/Add/Explore

* If you happen to spot a bug, please [report it](https://github.com/malliaris/SSNS/issues).  Comments, suggestions, and reports of confusing bug-like features also welcome!

* short-term small/easy items
  * mention of CoordTransition_Spin, etc. ?
  * write HV_ST_CH help page
  * make sure HV_P_* help pages are complete/consistent
  * debug PlotTypeXT.update_window()
  * add minimum width/xlim of ~10 to PlotTypeHX

* A handful of system types listed in the [abbreviations](#abbreviations-labels-etc) section are only at the concept stage, i.e., not yet implemented.  The strategy in the early period of **SSNS** development was to keep a small but diverse collection of systems implemented so that the machinery of <samp>Trajectory</samp>, <samp>PlotType</samp>, etc. classes evolved in a well directed but agile way.  This means that addition of new system types should generally not require app-wide refactoring.<br/><br/>Some system types are incredibly quick to implement &mdash; take a look at the Gingerbread-man Map <samp>*_GM</samp> classes in [js/system_types/GM.js](js/system_types/GM.js).  Others are more complicated, like those planned for the fluids <samp>FD</samp> category.  The current idea for <samp>PF</samp> involves a highly simplified system where Newton's laws yield a trajectory in closed form (it would just need to be evaluated at discrete time points).  For <samp>EU</samp>, the 1D shock tube, we'll need some numerical integration, so we'll implement a straightforward algorithm with a fixed-size time step.  Whether 2D flow systems are even feasible depends on (1) availability of libraries to handle the integration (2) computational expense of integration (see last bullet point) (3) adequacy of visualization options (4) availability of free time &#x1F642;.

* Most of the SSNS system types track one (or maybe a handful) of dependent variables over time, and so the derived <samp>Coords</samp> object for these systems has a very small memory footprint.  Exceptions are the <samp>SM</samp> spin systems <samp>IS</samp> and <samp>XY</samp> &mdash; for them, the <samp>Coords</samp> object holds a 2D field of spin values, and can be orders of magnitude larger.  Since we don't want to put the task of **SSNS** memory management on the browser, our options for capping the spin system <samp>Trajectory</samp> footprint are: (1) statically cap both grid size <samp>N</samp> and max duration <samp>t_max</samp> (2) adaptive caps so that larger grids are allowed for shorter trajectories, and vice versa (3) something more clever.<br/><br/>We already have in place a required <samp>Trajectory</samp> method <samp>get_max_num_t_steps()</samp> to allow for customized calculation of max duration.  Another angle is to reconsider exactly what is stored in the spin <samp>Coords</samp> object.  Currently, the Metropolis algorithm by which these system types are updated modifies 0 or 1 spins each time step.  <samp>CoordTransition_Spin</samp> is a lightweight auxiliary class that stores ***only the change*** between consecutive spin array configurations.  An entire trajectory can be stored as, say, the initial array configuration, and one <samp>CoordTransition_Spin</samp> for each subsequent time step.<br/><br/>This potential approach is complicated by the fact that we currently use the HTML <samp>&lt;canvas&gt;</samp> element for spin system plotting, and also by the fact that it's always good to allow for Metropolis "candidate moves" that change multiple spins.  See the code comments around <samp>CoordTransition_Spin</samp> in [js/traj_intermed.js](js/traj_intermed.js) and <samp>PlotTypeHM</samp> in [js/PlotTypeHM.js](js/PlotTypeHM.js).  Also see next bullet point, which is related.

* When it comes to web implementations of the <samp>XY</samp> model, ours pales in comparison to the one found <a href="//kjslag.github.io/XY/">here</a>, and for many reasons &#x1F642;.  One is that, despite always running on a device with a GPU, **SSNS** does not use the GPU for non-graphical computation!  With all the attention on machine learning, general purpose GPU ("GPGPU") computing is really progressing.  WebGL (which <samp>kjslag</samp>'s implementation uses) is about a decade old, and its successor, WebGPU, is coming out now.  This development comes on top of all the GPU technology progress spurred by HTML 5 <samp>&lt;video&gt;</samp>, streaming, etc.  It's not trivial to write code to execute on a GPU, but the potential performance jump alone is enough to keep this on the "to explore" list!

* lower priority items
  * not too familiar with how <samp>const</samp>ness works in JavaScript, but change <samp>let</samp> to <samp>const</samp> wherever possible
  * what about JavaScript "strict mode"?
  * handle support for very old browsers?
